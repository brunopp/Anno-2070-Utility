Anno-2070-Utility
=================

Fan-made tool that can calculate your population needs.

Contains
--------

* Anno 2070 Utility - Web version that functions offline. It utilizes [JQuery](www.jquery.com), [Knockout](www.knockoutjs.com) and [Bootstrap](www.getbootstrap.com).
* Anno 2070 XML to JSON - Extracts data from the Anno 2070 files that are needed in Anno 2070 Utility.

TO-DO
-----

* Disabling function under production chain is still a little buggy.
* Design needs work (looks poorly on mobile).
